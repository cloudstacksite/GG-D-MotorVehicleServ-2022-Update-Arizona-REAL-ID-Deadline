            <p>
                Did you know that in May of 2023, you’ll need a REAL ID to travel by air? If you don’t have one by the May 3, 2023 REAL ID deadline, consider your flight grounded. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, you have some time before the requirement is in place to get your new ID. Read on to learn more about an Arizona REAL ID, how to get one, what you need to get it, and how much it will cost you. We’ve got you covered so the deadline doesn’t ruin your travel plans. 
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>What Is an Arizona REAL ID?</h2>
            <p>
                After 9/11, the 9/11 Commission recommended that the federal government create standards for identification sources. The resulting <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/real-id-act-text.pdf">REAL ID Act</a>, which was passed by Congress in 2005, requires minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cars. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Ace prohibits federal agencies from accepting licenses and identification from states that have not met the standards. This means that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is the federal agency that handles airport security, cannot accept your license to allow you through a security checkpoint at the airport to board a flight.
            </p>
            <p>
                A REAL ID will have a gold star embedded in it. This will tell you if your ID complies or not. Non-REAL IDs will not have this gold star on them. The gold star indicates that the cardholder provided additional proof of identification to meet the federal REAL ID Act requirements.

            <h2>What Happens When REAL ID Enforcement Begins?</h2>
            <p>
                On May 3, 2023, federal agencies will not accept any state-issued identification cards or driver’s licenses for the purpose of accessing federal facilities, such as the secure area of the airport, if it was not issued by a REAL ID-compliant state. If your state is out of compliance, you will not be permitted to go through the security checkpoint. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some states, like Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, and Washington, have what is known as Enhanced Driver’s Licenses (EDL). EDLs are considered an acceptable alternative to the REAL ID. 
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>Do I Need a Federally-Compliant Travel ID?</h2>
            <p>
                Arizona residents are not required to obtain a travel ID, unless they are planning on air travel following the May 3, 2023 deadline. However, a valid passport will suffice in order to pass security checkpoints and board a commercial aircraft. Current driver’s licenses and IDs are still accepted to enter restricted federal buildings and military bases up through the May 2023 deadline.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>What Do I Need To Get a Real ID?</h2>
            <p>
                REAL ID requirements include additional documents to prove your identity. In order to get an AZ REAL ID, you will need to present three things. These include: 
            </p>
            <h3>1. Proof of Identity</h3>
            <p>
                You should bring ONE of the following: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Certified birth certificate (should be issued by a city, county, or state vital statistics office)</li>
                <li>US passport</li>
                <li>Passport card</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Your Social Security number</h3>
            <p>
                You do not need to provide a document proving your Social Security number as you did previously. Rather, you just have to provide the complete number.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Proof of Arizona Residency</h3>
            <p>
                You will need TWO of the following to prove that you are a resident of the state of Arizona:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A utility bill showing your Arizona address</li>
                <li>Credit card statement showing your Arizona address</li>
                <li>Bank statement showing your Arizona address</li>
                <li>Insurance policy showing your Arizona address</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you do not have the required Arizona residency documents, you may fill out an <a href="https://apps.azdot.gov/files/mvd/mvd-forms-lib/40-5143.pdf">Arizona Residency Affidavit</a> and use that as one of your residency documents.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>Do Children Need a REAL ID?</h2>
            <p>
                The TSA does not require REAL IDs or any identification for children younger than 18 if they are traveling domestically with a companion. The companion will need appropriate identification.
            </p>
            <p>
                Airlines may have specific requirements, though, so you should check with your airline before arriving at the airport.

            </p>
            <p>
                This is in part due to the COVID-19 situation and the need to lessen the number of attendants in MVD and <a href="https://www.ggandd.com/locations/">third-party MVD locations</a>. However, <a href="https://www.ggandd.com/">GG&D</a> locations are now open and accepting walk-ins for individuals looking to fulfill their Travel ID requirements ahead of the deadline.

            <h2>What is an Arizona Travel ID?</h2>
            <p>
                The Arizona Travel ID is compliant with the REAL ID Act of 2005, mandating air travelers to carry a federally-approved proof of identification in order to fly. This is available both for a <a href="https://www.ggandd.com/driver-licenses-ids/">driver’s license and ID card</a>.
